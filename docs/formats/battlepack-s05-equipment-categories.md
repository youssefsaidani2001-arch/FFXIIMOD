# Battlepack section 5 — Equipment Categories

Spec id: `battlepack-s05-equipment-categories` · machine spec: [`battlepack-s05-equipment-categories.json`](./battlepack-s05-equipment-categories.json)

Battlepack **section 5** names the equipment categories (Unarmed, Sword, Greatsword … Bomb). Each 4-byte row is a
description text id and a name text id; the row index is the category id used by equipment records and by the
party-member "restricted equipment categories" bitfield (TK L807, L914).

## Container

### The battlepack container (`battle_pack.bin`)

Full container spec: [`container-battlepack.md`](./container-battlepack.md) (st2e details:
[`container-st2e.md`](./container-st2e.md) where present). Summary of what matters for this section:

- **Archive path:** `ps2data/image/ff12/test_battle/<lang>/binaryfile/battle_pack.bin` inside the game's VBF
  (msg 402 gives the `us` folder; the Workshop also recognises `in`, `kr`, `cn`, `ch` language folders,
  IW Helpers/PackHelper.cs:593-602). Each language folder carries its own copy.
- **Header:** `u32 sectionCount` at 0x00 (71 for `battle_pack.bin`, IW Resources/PackFile.cs:20), followed by
  `sectionCount + 1` `u32` offsets measured from the start of the file. The extra last offset is the end of the
  last section's data **before** the final padding (IW Helpers/PackHelper.cs:41-46, 87).
- **Sections:** section *i* occupies `[offset[i], offset[i+1])`. Every section starts on a 16-byte boundary;
  the gap is zero-filled, so a section's span includes its own trailing pad (IW Helpers/PackHelper.cs:51, 77).
  An empty section has `offset[i] == offset[i+1]`. The file ends with zero padding to a multiple of 16
  (IW Helpers/PackHelper.cs:88).
- **Resizing:** if a section's padded length changes, every later offset and the end offset move by the same
  delta; nothing else in the pack points across sections (the Workshop rebuilds the table from scratch,
  IW Helpers/PackHelper.cs:64-96).
- **Unpacked naming:** the Workshop writes section *i* as `battle_pack.bin.dir/section_<iii>.bin`
  (IW Helpers/PackHelper.cs:58); this spec's `files` glob includes that name for single-section editing.
- **In memory:** the game rewrites in-file offsets to absolute pointers after loading; the Toolkit's export
  converts them back before saving (TK L964-L976, L1794). Files on disk always hold offsets relative to the start of
  the section.


### The `st2e` section header (32 bytes)

| Offset | Size | Type | Name | Meaning | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0x00 | 4 | bytes | `magic` | ASCII `st2e` (`73 74 32 65`). | IW Formats/St2e.cs:9,20 |
| 0x04 | 4 | u32 | `entryCount` | Number of fixed-size entries. | IW Formats/St2e.cs:25 |
| 0x08 | 2 | u16 | `entrySize` | Bytes per entry. | IW Formats/St2e.cs:26 |
| 0x0A | 2 | bytes | `unknown0A` | Skipped by every reader; the Workshop writes zero. | IW Formats/St2e.cs:27,51 |
| 0x0C | 4 | u32 | `entryListOffset` | Offset of entry 0 from the section start; 0x20 when there is at least one entry, 0 when the table is empty. | IW Formats/St2e.cs:12,28,39 |
| 0x10 | 4 | u32 | `offset10` | Unknown offset slot; 0 in Workshop output. | IW Formats/St2e.cs:29,40 |
| 0x14 | 4 | u32 | `textSectionOffset` | Offset of an inline text block. Always 0 in the Workshop's output for the gameplay tables, and the Toolkit clears it when exporting a live section, i.e. the game fills it at run time; text itself is **not** stored in these sections. | IW Formats/St2e.cs:30,41; TK L251-L267, L978 |
| 0x18 | 4 | u32 | `offset18` | Unknown offset slot, except in section 13 where it is the attribute-table offset. | IW Formats/St2e.cs:31; TK L267 |
| 0x1C | 4 | u32 | `offset1C` | Unknown offset slot; 0 in Workshop output. | IW Formats/St2e.cs:32,43 |

Entries are packed back to back from `entryListOffset` (no per-entry alignment). After the last entry
(or the last extra table) the section is zero-padded to a multiple of 16 bytes (IW Helpers/BinaryHelper.cs:12-33).

Section 5 specifics: `entrySize` = 4 (0x4) (IW Formats/Battlepack/EquipmentCategories.cs:17).
The Workshop maps the unpacked file `section_005.bin` to this table (IW Resources/JsonFile.cs:27).
With 32 rows (TK L807) the section is 32 + 32*4 = 160 bytes (already a multiple of 16).

## Record layouts

All multi-byte values are little-endian. Offsets are relative to the start of the record. Rows typed `bytes` and named `unknown…`/`unused…` are not interpreted by any source; keep their original bytes.

### Record `header` — 32 bytes (0x20), count: 1

*Where:* Offset 0 of battlepack section 5.

| Offset | Size | Type | Name | Meaning | Enum / list | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0x00 | 4 | bytes | `magic` | ASCII 'st2e' (73 74 32 65); reject the section if different. |  | IW Formats/St2e.cs:9,20 |
| 0x04 | 4 | u32 | `entryCount` | Number of categories (32 in the vanilla game, TK L807). |  | IW Formats/St2e.cs:25 |
| 0x08 | 2 | u16 | `entrySize` | Bytes per entry; 4 (0x4) for this section. |  | IW Formats/St2e.cs:26 |
| 0x0A | 2 | bytes | `unknown0A` | Not interpreted; keep. |  | IW Formats/St2e.cs:27 |
| 0x0C | 4 | u32 | `entryListOffset` | Offset of entry 0 from the section start: 32 when entryCount > 0, else 0. |  | IW Formats/St2e.cs:12,28,39 |
| 0x10 | 4 | u32 | `offset10` | Unknown offset slot (0 in Workshop output). |  | IW Formats/St2e.cs:29,40 |
| 0x14 | 4 | u32 | `textSectionOffset` | Inline text offset; 0 on disk for this section (filled at run time). No strings are stored here. |  | IW Formats/St2e.cs:30,41; TK L262, L978 |
| 0x18 | 4 | u32 | `offset18` | Unknown offset slot (0 in Workshop output for this section). |  | IW Formats/St2e.cs:31,42 |
| 0x1C | 4 | u32 | `offset1C` | Unknown offset slot (0 in Workshop output). |  | IW Formats/St2e.cs:32,43 |

### Record `equipmentCategory` — 4 bytes (0x4), count: header.entryCount (vanilla 32)

*Where:* st2e entries of section 5: header.entryListOffset + i*4; row i = equipment category id i (row labels: list BpEquipmentCategoryList)

| Offset | Size | Type | Name | Meaning | Enum / list | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0x00 | 2 | u16 | `description` | Help text id of the category. |  | IW EquipmentCategories.cs:31,45; LL section05.md |
| 0x02 | 2 | u16 | `name` | Name text id; vanilla rows use 8223 + row (8223 Unarmed … 8249 Incendiaries). | `DescBattleMenuList` | IW EquipmentCategories.cs:32,46; LL section05.md; Lists: DescBattleMenuList |

### External lists referenced by `enum`

| List | What it names |
|---|---|
| `DescBattleMenuList` | battle-menu label text ids 8192-8254: battle-menu categories 8192+, magick categories 8210+, elements 8215+, equipment categories 8223+ |

## Count and size rules

- One row per category id. The Toolkit names ids 0-26 (Unarmed … Bomb) and 27-31 as unused, 255 = none
  (Lists: BpEquipmentCategoryList; TK L1617). Bit *i* of section 16's 32-bit restriction word forbids category *i*
  (TK L914), so do not grow past 32 rows.
- Rows are referenced by index; never reorder.

### Text

These tables hold no strings. Every name/description field is a **u16 text id** in the game-wide battle text
id space, which is split into blocks per family (TK L1520-L1563): e.g. action names 0+, equipment names
2048+, battle-menu labels 8192+, status names 10240+, gambit names 12288+, character names 16384+, bazaar
names 18432+; long help texts use ids 3000+, 4000+ (battle actions), 10000+ (inventory actions), 12000+ (status),
16000+ (gambit targets), 22000+ (bazaar). `65535` means *none*. The strings live in the text files of the nested
pack in battlepack **section 61** (15 sub-sections, IW Resources/PackFile.cs:21, IW Resources/OtherFile.cs:23,
msg 1005) and in section 2. Renaming something is a text edit there, not an edit here.

The Toolkit's battle-menu label list holds the equipment-category names at 8223-8254, in row order
(Lists: DescBattleMenuList), so a vanilla row *i* has `name` = 8223 + *i*. The description block is not identified.

## Pointers

None. Incoming: equipment category bytes in section 13 and the restriction bitfield in section 16.

## Round-trip rules

- Edit fields in place; the record size is fixed and nothing in this section points at entries, so value edits never move data.
- Copy every byte that no field interprets (unknown*/padding, unnamed bits) from the original; the Workshop writer zero-fills them (it seeks over them), so do not use its output as the byte-identical reference.
- Keep the st2e header bytes verbatim except entryCount (and entryListOffset when the count goes to/from 0).
- Keep the trailing zero padding that rounds the section to a multiple of 16 bytes.
- If the section length changes (added/removed entries), rewrite the battlepack offset table: every later section offset and the end offset shift by the padded size delta.

## Known unknowns

- Text block of the description ids is not identified.
- Vanilla entryCount assumed 32 (TK L807 "the 32 categories"); not checked on a dump.
